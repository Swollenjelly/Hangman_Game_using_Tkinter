# Hangman_Game_using_Tkinter
Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.

For this one, a window opens with some number of blanck spaces, and every wrong letter guessed adds to the stick figure of a man being hanged!
